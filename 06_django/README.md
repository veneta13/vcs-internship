# Getting started with Django

Django is a Python framework for creating app applications. It's very useful because it provides ORM and API functionalities out of the box.


## _> Create a Django web application
Using Django and React.js, create a simple copy of [linkslist.app](https://www.linkslist.app/app). Your application should use the client-server architecture.

***Technical requirements:***
- UI (Front-end) is done using React.js. You can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to help yourself.
- Use SASS for styling. Use classes to re-use styles as you see fit.
- Use Django for Back-end server
- Use the [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for the API endpoints
- Add unit tests for the APIs! Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/)

***Functional requirements:***
- At the very least, your application should allow users to create, edit, delete and share link lists.
- Lists can be "public" and "private"
- You should be able to register and login users
- Gather "page previews" of links in the lists

You have full freedom with how it should look :)
